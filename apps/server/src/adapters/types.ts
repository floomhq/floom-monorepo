// Adapter interfaces for the Floom reference server (Stage 2 of the protocol
// opening, 2026-04-20).
//
// The reference implementation in this repo pins ONE concrete impl for each
// of the five concerns below — Docker + HTTP proxy for runtime, SQLite for
// storage, Better Auth for identity, encrypted SQLite columns for secrets,
// and in-process counters + Sentry for observability. This file publishes
// the interface contracts for those five concerns so an alternate server
// (Kubernetes runtime, Postgres storage, Auth0 auth, Vault secrets, OTEL
// metrics, etc.) can see exactly what to implement.
//
// IMPORTANT: these are DECLARATIONS ONLY. The existing services don't
// implement these interfaces explicitly yet — that refactor is deliberately
// deferred (YAGNI + launch risk; see spec/adapters.md). The cost of
// committing to the shapes now is near-zero, the value is that anyone
// reading spec/adapters.md knows what an alternate implementation would look
// like without reading the reference server's source tree.
//
// Source of truth for per-method semantics and invariants: spec/adapters.md.

// 1. RuntimeAdapter
// =====================================================================

/**
 * Executes one action of a Floom app and returns a normalized result.
 *
 * The reference server ships two implementations today:
 *   1. `services/docker.ts` — spawns a Docker container per run, binds the
 *      app's code, injects secrets as env vars, streams stdout/stderr,
 *      enforces a timeout + memory cap, and parses the `__FLOOM_RESULT__`
 *      marker line from the container's stdout.
 *   2. `services/proxied-runner.ts` — forwards an HTTP request to an
 *      upstream API (for apps registered via OpenAPI spec URL), injects
 *      declared secrets into the configured auth header / cookie / query
 *      param, and classifies HTTP status codes into the `ErrorType`
 *      taxonomy.
 *
 * Both are selected at dispatch time by `services/runner.ts` based on
 * `app.app_type` ('docker' | 'proxied'). An alternate runtime (Firecracker,
 * Kubernetes Job, serverless function, WASM sandbox) would replace one or
 * both.
 *
 * Invariants a correct adapter MUST preserve:
 *   - Timeout enforcement — the adapter MUST kill the run after
 *     `app.timeout_ms` (or the server's `RUNNER_TIMEOUT` default) and
 *     return `{ status: 'timeout', error_type: 'timeout' }`. The job queue
 *     in `services/worker.ts` relies on this upper bound to make progress.
 *   - Secret injection — values in `secrets` are injected into the
 *     runtime's execution environment (env vars for containers, auth
 *     headers for proxy). Secrets MUST NOT appear in `logs` (scrub or
 *     never log them) and MUST NOT appear in `outputs`.
 *   - Output shape — `outputs` is the app's successful return payload,
 *     unmodified. Errors go to `error` / `error_type`, not to `outputs`.
 *     (The one exception is `detectSilentError` in runner.ts — see
 *     spec/adapters.md.)
 *   - Log capture — stdout + stderr (or equivalent) is captured to
 *     `logs` so the /p/:slug surface and `GET /api/run/:id` can show the
 *     creator what happened.
 *   - Async safety — `execute` may be called concurrently for different
 *     runs of the same app; no shared mutable state outside the per-run
 *     container / request.
 */
export interface RuntimeAdapter {
  /**
   * Run `action` of `app` with the given `inputs` and injected `secrets`.
   * Called by `services/runner.ts dispatchRun` after it has resolved the
   * secret precedence chain (global → per-app → user vault / creator
   * override → per-call `_auth`).
   *
   * `onOutput` is optional and lets the control plane stream partial
   * stdout/stderr to the log bus (see `lib/log-stream.ts`) before the run
   * finishes. Adapters that cannot stream (e.g. a fire-and-forget serverless
   * invocation) MAY omit calls to `onOutput` and emit everything at the end
   * in the returned `RuntimeResult.logs`.

// =====================================================================

/**
 * Persists Floom's durable state: apps, runs, jobs, workspaces, users,
 * and the pointer rows for secrets (the ciphertext is owned by
 * `SecretsAdapter`, not this interface).
 *
 * The reference implementation uses `better-sqlite3` against a local file
 * (`data/floom-chat.db`); see `db.ts` for the schema and migrations. An
 * alternate impl could use Postgres, PlanetScale, Durable Objects, etc.,
 * as long as the invariants below hold.
 *
 * Methods are intentionally minimal — only the ones `routes/*` and
 * `services/*` actually call today. Add methods when a new route needs
 * one; do NOT pre-define a "full CRUD" surface that nobody calls.
 *
 * Invariants a correct adapter MUST preserve:
 *   - FK ordering on delete — deleting an app MUST cascade to its runs,
 *     jobs, secret-policy rows, and creator-secret rows. The SQLite
 *     reference impl relies on `ON DELETE CASCADE` for `runs` and
 *     `jobs`; adapters without FK cascades MUST emulate it.
 *   - Transaction boundaries — `createRun` + `updateRun` across the
 *     lifecycle of one run MUST be serializable wrt reads. The job
 *     worker poll (`nextQueuedJob`) MUST be atomic with `claimJob` so two
 *     workers never pick the same job.
 *   - Tenant scoping — every tenant-addressable table (apps, runs,
 *     app_memory, user_secrets, connections, ...) MUST filter on
 *     `workspace_id`. OSS adapters MAY hardcode `workspace_id = 'local'`
 *     but MUST still include the column so the same queries work in
 *     Cloud mode.
 *   - Idempotency — `createApp` / `createRun` with a pre-existing id
 *     MUST either upsert or throw a deterministic error; callers retry
 *     on network failure.

// 3. AuthAdapter
// =====================================================================

/**
 * Resolves a request into a `SessionContext` and handles sign-in / sign-up /
 * sign-out.
 *
 * The reference impl is `lib/better-auth.ts`, which wraps Better Auth
 * 1.6.3 with email+password + GitHub/Google OAuth + API keys +
 * organizations. In OSS mode the adapter is effectively a no-op: every
 * request resolves to `SessionContext.workspace_id = 'local'`,
 * `user_id = 'local'`, with a synthetic device cookie for pre-login
 * continuity.
 *
 * Floom's surface needs only three things from the identity layer:
 *   1. `{ user_id, workspace_id, email? }` on every authenticated request.
 *   2. A way to sign users in / up / out.
 *   3. A hook to clean up per-user data when an account is deleted
 *      (W4-minimal POST /auth/delete-user).
 *
 * The adapter DOES NOT need to expose MFA, magic link, passkeys, OAuth
 * provider enumeration, session rotation policies, rate limits, or any
 * other provider-specific feature. Those are adapter-internal details.
 *
 * Invariants a correct adapter MUST preserve:
 *   - `getSession` returns `null` (not a SessionContext with fake ids) for
 *     unauthenticated requests in cloud mode, so the middleware can
 *     return 401. In OSS mode `getSession` MAY always return the local
 *     context.
 *   - A successful sign-in MUST emit a cookie or token that `getSession`
 *     can later resolve. The adapter owns the cookie name / header
 *     format; callers never inspect it directly.
 *   - `onUserDelete` runs AFTER the account row is gone, not before —
 *     callers rely on it to cascade-delete per-user rows
 *     (`app_memory`, `user_secrets`, `connections`, ...).

// =====================================================================

/**
 * Stores per-workspace, per-user encrypted secrets and resolves them into
 * plaintext env vars for a run.
 *
 * The reference impl is two files — `services/user_secrets.ts` (per-user
 * vault) and `services/app_creator_secrets.ts` (creator override with
 * per-app policy) — both backed by AES-256-GCM encrypted columns on
 * SQLite. The master key is `FLOOM_MASTER_KEY`, the per-workspace DEK
 * is wrapped by it, and no plaintext value is ever persisted or logged.
 *
 * An alternate impl could use HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, GCP
 * Secret Manager, Bitwarden, or env vars on a single-user box. Floom
 * never reads the plaintext outside the moment of injecting it into the
 * runtime — that invariant is what lets adapters treat the store as
 * fully opaque.
 *
 * Invariants a correct adapter MUST preserve:
 *   - Plaintext is never returned by `list()` — only key names +
 *     timestamps. `get()` is the only unmasking path.
 *   - `loadForRun()` MUST filter to the `keys` the caller requested,
 *     never return extras. Callers pass the exact
 *     `manifest.secrets_needed` list so unrelated creds don't leak into
 *     apps that don't need them.
 *   - Deletion is idempotent — deleting a missing key returns false, not
 *     an error.
 *   - Creator-override keys MUST NOT fall back to the user vault.
 *     Precedence is a control-plane concern (runner.ts), but the
 *     adapter MUST keep the two namespaces distinct
 *     (`loadUserVaultForRun` and `loadCreatorOverrideForRun`).

 * format. Everything is optional — a Floom server with neither of these

 *
 * An alternate impl could forward to OpenTelemetry, Datadog, StatsD, New
 * Relic, Honeycomb, etc. The adapter is intentionally side-effect-only:
 * nothing in the control plane ever reads back from observability.
 *
 * Invariants a correct adapter MUST preserve:
 *   - Never throw from any method. An observability bug MUST NOT break
 *     the request. The reference Sentry impl wraps `captureException`
 *     in try/catch; adapters MUST do the same.
 *   - Scrub secrets — `captureError` context MUST NOT leak tokens,
 *     passwords, API keys, or cookie values. The reference impl's
 *     `scrubSecrets` helper is a minimal reference.
 *   - Tags — counter / timing / gauge metrics accept a `tags` map; the

 *     labels, DD tags, OTEL attributes). Callers pick the keys.
