/**
 * Cleanup orphaned Floom data when a user is deleted from Better Auth.
 * 
 * Logic:
 * 1. Find all workspaces where the user was a member.
 * 2. Delete the user from Floom's mirrored `users` table.
 * 3. For each workspace:
 *    a. Check if any members remain.
 *    b. If no members remain (and the workspace isn't 'local'):
 *       - Delete apps that are not 'public'.
 *       - Re-assign 'public' apps to the 'local' workspace (orphaned by user, retained for Hub).
 *       - Clean up associated records in tables without FK CASCADE on workspace_id:
 *         run_threads, app_reviews, feedback, and per-app secrets.
 *       - Delete the workspace (triggers CASCADE for workspace_members, app_memory, etc.).
